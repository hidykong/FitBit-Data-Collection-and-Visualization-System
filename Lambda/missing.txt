This file is to add some notes, so a user can make this code run:

In order to make this functional, you need to add back in the keys and names that I marked as missing.
Additionally, you need to save into the folder certain python modules (this is so one can zip and upload
the file to the lambda function).
The modules needed are:
	json
	fitbit
	requests
	sys
	datetime
	boto3
	Decimal (from decimal)
If there are any issues, first check for all modules. Additionally, it is possible that one of those modules need a newer/additional module. So check for that.

All of this information, needs to be saved into a .zip file and uploaded to your lambda file.
Then to run it, open the link that you have created and check if it saved the data.

A future improvement could be to separate authorization and saving data into 2 separate lambda functions to prevent overloading one and to get the user back to the app faster.
